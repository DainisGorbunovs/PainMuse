Pre-preparation: pair your Muse with your device via Bluetooth.
Starting Muse takes 1s.

1. Launch muse-io:
muse-io --preset 14 --osc osc.udp://localhost:5006

2. Run the Twilio nodejs server

3. Change the server address in painMuse and then launch painMuse:
node painMuse.js

Might need to install osc first:
npm install osc

4. Wear Muse tightly to the forehead. Rise eyebrows as you are suprised.
Eyebrows naturally rise when you are in pain.
